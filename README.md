# divelog
This code is currently running at https://seasaba-divelog-frontend.onrender.com/ and other locations on render.com

The purpose of this is to allow divemasters to log dives and sightings into a database.

The database is then available to marine scientists as well as being displayed on my main website, seasaba.com.
